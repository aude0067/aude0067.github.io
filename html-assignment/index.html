                I also love going to rodeo's and I dream to have a horse and a cow. I am a <em>girly</em> girl but a the same time I love my werstern side.
                 I'd consider myself pretty extraveted and driven  </p>

             <h2> Dreams and Motivation</h2>    

                 <p>In the furtur, I want to do so many stuff.
